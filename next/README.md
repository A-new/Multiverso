# Multiverso Next [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Microsoft/multiverso-next.svg?token=3HGpfszLKUkgnzxh5Z6R&branch=liming)](https://travis-ci.com/Microsoft/multiverso-next)

Let's use this repo to discuss, design and develop next version of Multiverso. Feel free to modify the project and push directly. We can discuss based on your commit. This repo is more for long-term version. For some small optimization, we'd better work on our own repos and pull request to the released multiverso. However, this would still be the wonderfull place to work together when you start to try your design and optimization ideas. 

## code style

I suggest to follow the Google C++ style.

## third-party library

I think it's fine to use some open source library, like glog/gflags/gtest/protobuf/Eigen. 

gtest would be great for unit test. 

## guilds

Make issues for discussion.

Feel free to push directly. It is unnecessary to folk and pull request. 

Enjoy!
